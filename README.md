# Notik

Notik is a terminal based note management solution. You can use it without leaving your lovely workflow.

## Story

I use vim and terminal a lot. Wanted to have something that's going to help me to track things and knowledge.
I'm not big fan of Notion so I built my own :^)

## Installation

- Run `git clone git@git.berkaycubuk.com:berkay/notik.git` command where you want to use this software.
- Build the project with `go build`.
- Add `notik` file to your path.
- Create .notikrc config file in your home directory. Set your editor and docspath like this:
    ```
    set editor vi
    set docspath /Documents/notik
    ```
